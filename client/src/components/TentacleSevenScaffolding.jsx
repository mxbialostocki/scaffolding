The truck takes the corner too quickly and skids on the road still wet with rain. It spirals out of control and – as you leap out of the way – you see the truck veer off the road and into your site. It leaves a truck-shaped hole and row of buckled metal in its wake. Please re-erect your scaffolding.</Typography>
