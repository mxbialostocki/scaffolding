# Super-Suburban Dream Home&trade;

## The landing page is a black screen screen with an image of a house in the centre. There are no instructions – the player must click on the house to begin:

## The next page that opens is black, with white CAPITALISED slightly ‘old-school’ font (like an arcade game). The player is given two options to choose from. Each option should be ‘hyperlinked’ to take the player to the next screen when they click: Welcome! Please choose an option to build your Super-Suburban Dream Home™. You already have a blueprint and a building site, and are ready to start building! Do you:

1. Start from scratch. You visit the local hardware store to enquire about different wood grains. You want everything to be perfect.
2. Find a shortcut. Your friend is a builder, and they agree to help you out. There is some leftover stone from another site which they can use to lay the foundations. They can begin site preparations on, say, Monday? You accept their offer. If the player chose 1: While you were at the hardware store, the company you have shares in goes broke and their stocks plummet. You lose thousands, and realise that there is no other option: you are forced to abandon your project and move in with you sister. Click here to play again.’ (player is returned to first screen and must click on the house to start over). If the player chose 2: Monday arrives and the weather couldn’t be better. Your friend and his team begin to excavate the site. You are about to leave, when one of the builders cries out. Upon rushing over, you see that they have unearthed what looks like, a human skull. Do you:

1. Call the police! You’ve heard about several missing-person cases in this part of the city and want to help however you can – plus, you might be on TV.
2. Keep it quiet. You know that the build will be seriously delayed if your site becomes a crime-scene. You get out your wallet and bribe the builder. Hopefully they keep their mouth shut.

If the player chose 2: That night, the same builder is out drinking and does not keep their mouth shut. A member of neighbourhood watch happens to overhear, and they call the police. You – as the owner of the site – are arrested as a suspect. Click here to play again.

If the player chose 1: You are on TV! Due to the new evidence, the police are able to solve one of Vancouver’s most puzzling cold cases. Your project is delayed significantly. However, one day, you receive a letter informing you that a local charity is offering to donate you $50,000 for your role in the case. A fountain bearing your name will also be erected downtown. Do you:

1. Accept! You’ve already lost money because of the delays, and are worried you won’t be able to resume building until next year.
2. Thank the charity for their kind offer, but suggest they donate the money to a project which is more community oriented. Perhaps the Vancouver Heritage Foundation? You still receive the fountain.

If the player chose 2: Without the donation you cannot afford to continue building. Your site is overrun with weeds and walking past it makes you sad. You visit the fountain every day, and, as you stare into the water, you realise that your dreams have evaporated in a mist of fountain-spray. You sell the site, and sign up for a yoga retreat in California. You never look back. Click here to play again.

If the player chose 1: With the donation, you are able to resume building just in time for Spring. The foundations are laid and preparations are made to begin building the frame. However, when you look at the plan you realise that there has been a mistake. The original plan had two stories, but this plan only has one! You point this out to the site manager, who tells you that you will need to resubmit a new consent form to the council. Do you:

1. Ignore their advice. It took the council months to approve your first application. On a project this size the council is unlikely to check-in anyway. Make it two stories!
2. While you decide that it’s not worth your time dealing with the council again, you also don’t want to break any laws. You will have sacrifice the upstairs gym-room. If the player chose 1: The builders refuse to risk their jobs on your project and if they quit, your foundations will – literally – crumble. You are left with no choice but to agree to the one-story plan. The wood for the frame is brought to the site but it is full of termites! You lose it and fire everyone on the spot. Your foundations crumble and the house is never built. Click here to play again.

If the player chose 2: The wood for the frame is brought to the site but it is full of termites! You are about to lose it and fire everyone on the spot, but you catch yourself at the last minute. New wood is ordered and – after a week-long delay – the frame is finally ready for construction and a scaffolding is erected. It’s finally happening! As you walk around the site to get some good photos, you nearly break your ankle on something that rolls under your shoe. You bend down and realise that it’s a small bolt. Do you:

1. Pick the bolt up. Rolling it around the palm of your hand, you realise that it might be important and hobble over to give it to the nearest builder.
2. Curse at the pain flashing through your ankle. You leave the bolt on the ground and hobble around the corner to get a better photo of the scaffolding.

If the player chose 2: You are taking a photo when there is a shout and the sound of grating metal. You watch on in horror as one bar of scaffolding separates from the frame andcrashes to the ground, taking the entire edifice with it. A thorough investigation is launched by the site manager, who discovers that the central bracing was missing a bolt. Your swollen ankle throbs. Please re-erect your scaffolding.

Here, instead of being taken back to the landing page, they are taken back to the previous scenario (beginning with ‘The wood for the frame….’. To progress, the player must choose 1. = to give the bolt to the nearest builder). Below the text, this image appears:

The player must click on this to proceed. In an ideal world, there will also be a row of italic text under the image which is a quote from the book I am concerned with (Occasional Work and Seven Walks from the Office for Soft Architecture by Lisa Robertson). E.g “We could say scaffolding is a furnishing insofar as it supports the desires of our bodies.” So that the whole page would look something like:
From now on, one option will ALWAYS take the player to a scenario which asks them to re- erect their scaffolding, with the image and a line of italic quoted text.

If the player chose 1: The builder looks at the bolt that you have just given them with horror and rushes over to the site manager. The scaffolding is evacuated and de-assembled, then re-assembled with the crucial bolt fixed in place. You avert a disaster and construction of the frame begins! A couple of weeks pass without incident, but then, on the eve of the frame’s completion, an electrical storm hits. The site manager advises you to stop construction until the stop has passed. Do you:

1. Decide to build through the storm – the frame is so close to being finished! What’s a bit of rain?
2. Listen to the site manager. The wind has picked up and the rain has reduced the site to a muddy swap. You call off the build for a few days. If the player chose 2: The storm takes no prisoners. After the rain has stopped, lightning strikes a nearby Elm tree which promptly catches fire. The wind carries embers from the Scenario text. Please er- erect your scaffolding.

blaze and deposits them on the frame. Because the site is empty, no one is around to put
out the fire. Your frame is burned to the ground. Please re-erect your scaffolding.

If the player chose 1: The site manager gives you the silent treatment. The builders work
through the storm, and finally, the frame is completed. Sometime in the afternoon, a nearby
Elm tree is struck by lightning and catches fire. You watch it for a while, and then realise that
the blaze is dangerously close to yoSuper-Suburban Dream Home™

1. The landing page is a black screenur site. The flames are getting larger and larger. Do you:
1. Call the fire-brigade!
2. Your ex-partner is a fire-fighter and you have been successfully avoiding each other
for two years. So instead, you assemble a group of builders to help you put out the
fire. You find every vessel you can, fill it with water and rush over to the Elm tree.
If the player chose 1: You hear a siren in the distance, and soon a fire-engine comes hurtling
around the corner. Really hurtling. The truck takes the corner too quickly and skids on the
road still wet with rain. It spirals out of control and – as you leap out of the way – you see
the truck veer off the road and into your site. It leaves a truck-shaped hole and row of
buckled metal in its wake. Please re-erect your scaffolding.

If the player chose 2: You and the builders manage to put out the fire, and the frame is
completed that evening. The next day, the doors and window arrive. You are particularly
excited about the front door which you bought on craigslist. Designed in the Arts and Crafts
style, the door is a genuine antique, and set in the top quarter of the door is a single glass
pane engraved with a row of tiny strawberries. You grew up on a strawberry farm and
harbour a special affinity with the small fruit. You hold your breath as two builders lift the
door off the truck, but it makes it to the front of the house in one piece. This is a big
moment for you, and you want to be the first one to walk through the doorway. Do you:
1. Wait until everyone has left the site, so that no one sees the tears of joy in your
eyes.
2. Run over to the door immediately and ask the site-manager to film you opening it.
If the player chose 1: It is dark by the time everyone has left the site. You walk up to the
door which – although you know it is just a trick of the moonlight – seems to emit a faint
glow. A single tear comes to rest on your cheek. You place your hand on the door handle,
which is cool to the touch and fits perfectly into the palm of your hand. Turning your wrist,
you take a deep breath and open the door. There is a flash of violet light mingled with the
smell of singed flesare no instructions – the player must click on the house to begin:

If the player chose 2: You throw your camera to the site-manager, who gives you a nod to
let you know that they have hit record. You place your hand on the door handle, which is
cool to the touch and fits perfectly into the palm of your hand. Turning your wrist, you take
a deep breath and open the door. There is a flash of violet light mingled with the smell of
singed flesh. The light touches the back of your eyeballs, and, in your last thinking moments,
you realise that the door was a portal. You are now elsewhere. Please re-erect your
scaffolding.
